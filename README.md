# Kata Mars Rover
The goal of this kata is to develop an API that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are
understood by the rover. This solution is based on the requirements and rules specified at https://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata

## Assumptions
Since a lot of things were not specified more precisely in the requirements and rules of the kata (at least
the kata as stated on the aforementioned link), I made some assumptions

1. Going in the north direction corresponds to moving towards the positive part of the y-axis
2. Going south is similar but towards the negative part of y-axis
3. Going to the east is going towards the positive part of the x-axis
4. Going to the west is going towards the negative part of the x-axis
